### Windows Event Logs
- Windows event logs are usually stored in `.evt` or `.evtx` files in `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs`
- The logs can be accessed with:
    1. Event Viewer (can be launched with `eventvwr.msc`)
    1. `Wevtutil.exe` (cmd tool)
    1. `Get-WinEvent` (Powershell cmdlet)
- There are 5 [types of events](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-types):
    1. Error: a significant problem e.g. a service that fails to load on startup
    1. Warning: not necessarily significant but could cause issues later
    1. Information: describes successful operation of an app, driver, or service
    1. Success Audit: record of an successful audited security access
    1. Failure Audit: record of an failed audited security access
- Important Events to watch out for
     - Windows Powershell
        - 104: indicator of logs being cleared with 
        - 400: indicator of Powershell downgrade attack
- Windows Defender
    - To view defender logs go to `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Windows Defender` in Event Viewer. [Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/troubleshoot-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide#windows-defender-av-ids)

### Sysmon
- Start Sysmon with config file: `Sysmon.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig-export.xml`
- List of the most important Events by ID that are analyzed by Sysmon
    - 1: Process Creation
        ```xml
        <!-- exclude svchost.exe process from event logs -->
        <RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
            <ProcessCreate onmatch="exclude">
                <CommandLine condition="is">C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k appmodel -p -s camsvc</CommandLine>
            </ProcessCreate>
        </RuleGroup>
        ```
    - 3: Network Connection: looks for events that occur remotely including suspicious binaries and opened ports
        ```xml
        <!-- identify suspicous network connection over port 4444 (commonly used by Metasploit) -->
        <RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
            <NetworkConnect onmatch="include">
                <Image condition="image">nmap.exe</Image>
                <DestinationPort name="Alert,Metasploit" condition="is">4444</DestinationPort>
            </NetworkConnect>
        </RuleGroup>
        ```
    - 7: Image Loaded:
        ```xml
        <!-- look for DLLs that have been loaded in the \Temp\ directory -->
        <RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
            <ImageLoad onmatch="include">
                <ImageLoaded condition="contains">\Temp\</ImageLoaded>
            </ImageLoad>
        </RuleGroup>
        ```
    - 8: CreateRemoteThread: monitor for processes injecting code into other processes
        ```xml
        <!-- look at the memory address for an ending condition which could indicate a Cobalt Strike beacon-->
        <RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
            <CreateRemoteThread onmatch="include">
                <StartAddress name="Alert,Cobalt Strike" condition="end with">0B80</StartAddress>
                <SourceImage condition="contains">\</SourceImage>
            </CreateRemoteThread>
        </RuleGroup>
        ```
    - 11: File Created: log events when files are created or overwritten
    - 12/13/14: Registry Event: looks for changes or modification to the registry
    - 15: FileCreateStreamHash: look for any files created in a alternate data stream
    - 22: DNS Event: log all DNS queries and events

### Splunk
Splunk can ingest a lot of data from event logs, website logs, firewall logs, etc.

- [Splunk Quick Reference](https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/solution-guides/splunk-quick-reference-guide.pdf)
- [Splunk Docs](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation)
- [splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/): database of Splunk apps

### Honeypots
- Tools
    - [HoneyBadger](https://github.com/0x6d6f7468/honeybadger): active defense framework for targeted geolocation
- Types
    - Low-interaction: little interactivity to the adversary. Adversaries can't perform any post-exploitation activity
    - Medium-interaction: collect data by emulating vulnerable services and the underlying OS
    - High-interaction: complete systems that are usually VMs that include deliberate vulns
- Deployment
    - Internal: inside a LAN
    - External: deployed on the open Internet
