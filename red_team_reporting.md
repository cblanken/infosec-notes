# Redteam Reporting Notes

Ref: Hack for Show Report for Dough Part II Talk by Brian "BB" King

## Your Report matters _MORE_ Than Your Hacking!
- What you _make_ is reports.
- Your report will influence what actions will be taken businesses will perform to better protect themselves.
- Your report is your product. It's a series of scenes. You are storyteller. Tell the story.


## Scanners
- Never just copy-paste scanner output
- How you _present_ your information is __MORE IMPORTANT__ than the information itself
- You're the expert here
    - apply your expertise
    - be better than a scanner
- Scanner output has no context, there's no story there


## Make It Obvious: don't just show, also tell
- Use highlights and appropriate context for any screenshots

## Not Mentioning Attacks that Failed
- This is part of the story and should be noted
    - It let's the client know how well their security team is doing
- Write enough to justify the expense
- Enough to show proof of work and why a system/network is secure in some aspects

## Use Your Words
- Two audiences: technical and business
- The process you show should be easily repeatable by a technical person to resolve the issue and correctly check the vulnerability is fixed
- The business will always have limited resources, so help them prioritise
- Don't be too technical in the executive summary, try to take a step back and view it as someone without any of the same technical knowledge
- The executive should be the first few pages, more technical details follow after
- Make it actionable, layout in plain language, the vulnerability exploited, the potential danger, and provide actionable resolutions
- Assume competence: never say "just", "simple", or "easily". There is almost always some extenuating circumstance for exceptions etc.

## How to Get Better At Reporting
- Screenshots: illustrate, don't decorate
    - Accurate: it's helpful and adds something that would be left out with words
    - Precise: it's clear
    - Crop to the relevant portion: you don't usually need to include a full screen capture
    - Direct the viewer's attention: boxes, arrows, highlights important parts
    - Dark Mode is Bad for screenshots, don't use it, think how will this report look if printed out on paper

## Microsoft Word / Report Writing
- Don't waste empty space, represent lists etc. in columns. Generally try to make information compact.
- Don't keep a folder full of screenshots: insert them into the editor for easy viewing
    - Use a tool like [Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/) or [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) for easy screen captures and editing
- Highlight, box, arrows screenshots 
- Use snippets
- Use macros
